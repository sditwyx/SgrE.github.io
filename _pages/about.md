I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in [Institute of Image Processing Pattern Recognition](http://www.pami.sjtu.edu.cn) at
[Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://www.sjtu.edu.cn).
My advisors are Prof. Jie Yang and Nanji Zhu.
Before coming to SJTU, I received the B.S. degree in control science and engineering from 
[Harbin Institute of Technology](http://www.hit.edu.cn) in 2014.

I am generally interested in statistical machine learning.
My research areas mainly include [kernel learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_method)
and [bayesian learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference).
Previously I have worked on [visual tracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_tracking) and I'm 
still interested in this topic.

Besides, doctorate in the study period, I have participated in several programmes 
related to infrared target detection, tracking, and recognition.

Here is my [CV](http://sgre.github.io/files/SgrE_CV.pdf).

The homepage is under construction and more information will be presented.
