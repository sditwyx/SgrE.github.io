I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in [Institute of Image Processing Pattern Recognition](http://www.pami.sjtu.edu.cn) at
[Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://www.sjtu.edu.cn).
My advisors are Prof. [Jie Yang](http://www.pami.sjtu.edu.cn/people/jieyang/) and Nanji Zhu.
Before coming to SJTU, I received the B.S. degree in control science and engineering from 
[Harbin Institute of Technology](http://www.hit.edu.cn) in 2014.

I am generally interested in statistical machine learning.
My research areas mainly include [kernel learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_method)
and [bayesian learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference).
Previously I have worked on [visual tracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_tracking) and I'm 
still interested in this topic.

Here is my [CV](http://sgre.github.io/files/SgrE_CV.pdf).

此外，博士期间承担若干总装备部、航天2院、8院等项目，涉及红外弱小目标检测、跟踪、识别、抗干扰等，作为主要完成人，已申报国防专利三项。

The homepage is under construction and more information will be presented.
