I am a final year Ph.D. student in [Institute of Image Processing Pattern Recognition](http://www.pami.sjtu.edu.cn) at
[Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://www.sjtu.edu.cn).
My advisor is Prof. [Jie Yang](http://www.pami.sjtu.edu.cn/jieyang).
Before coming to SJTU, I received the B.S. degree in control science and engineering from 
[Harbin Institute of Technology](http://www.hit.edu.cn) in 2014.

I’m generally interested in statistical machine learning, mainly on [kernel methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_method) regarding to data-adaptive
nonparametric kernel learning, out-of-sample extensions for nonparametric kernel methods,
indefinite kernel (real, symmetric, but not positive definite) learning, and kernel approximation in large
scale situations.
Previously I worked on [visual tracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_tracking) and I will follow up its progress. Besides, I’m interested in some
topics including [bayesian inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference), [approximation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation_theory), and [stochastic optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_optimization).


Here is my [CV](http://sgre.github.io/files/SgrE_CV.pdf).

The homepage is under construction and more information will be presented.

此外，博士期间承担若干项目，作为主要完成人，已申报国防专利三项。
